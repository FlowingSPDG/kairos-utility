# kairos-utility

A production-helper portable utility for Panasonic Kairos.

Concept of this tool is pretty much same as [vmix-utility](https://github.com/FlowingSPDG/vmix-utility).

This tool helps you to setting up your Kairos, such as generating a URL for switching, or executing macros.

WIP project.
